              Hello, my name is Ashley Ikeh and I am a soon-to-be certified
              software developer. It's nice to meet you!
            </p>

            <p>
              I received my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the
              University of Georgia. Though I was unaware at the time, I began
              my career in computer science as a secretary for the school's only
              Black honors society. I utilized websites like Mailchimp to create
              visually appealing newsletters to send out to over one hundred
              general body members. I also learned how to communicate
              professionally via email correspondence. Later, I continued this
              kind of work for one of UGA's Black mentoring organizations. I
              implemented external storage websites, like Google Drive, to
              organize and save crucial documents for the organization. My
              blossoming tech savviness was once again put to use during an
              internship I had before my senior year of college. I worked with a
              team in Atlanta City Hall to gather information to create a
              website for new business owners in the city. This was my first
              experience with data accumulation and consolidation. A process I
              am now more familiar with.
            </p>

            <p>
              After college I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of software
              development, so I chose to study full-stack software development
              with Georgia Institute of Technology. So far, I have been able to
              develop a solid understanding of languages like HTML, CSS, and
              Javascript. I have been exposed to libraries like jQuery and Node
              and have used API's to create dynamic websites. Each week I
              submitted assignments showcasing my knowledge of software
              development. These websites can be viewed on my Github page, as
              well as on the portfolio section of this website. My contact
              information is listed below, as well as, in the contact section of
              my website if you would like to reach me personally. I look
              forward to hearing from you soon!
