## Introduction

A portfolio is a crucial piece of the job search process for candidates across the globe. In 2020, a portfolio is an opportunity to showcase the highest quality work a professional has crafted during their career.
While paper portfolios are still the go-to medium for many jobseekers, it’s also important to possess a digital portfolio. As a newly trained software developer, it's only natural that I create a platform to showcase my creativity, as well as, the projects I have completed so far.

This website will supplement any job applications I submit, as well as, serve as a means of exposure to make a great first impression to those who visit my github profile or come across my website's URL. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please visit my website to view my contact information.
